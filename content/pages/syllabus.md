Lectures: 2 sessions / week, 2 hours / session

## General Course Description

This course explores contemporary American theatrical expression as it may be organized around issues of gender and cultural identity. This exploration will include the analysis of performances, scripts, and video documentation, as well as the invention of original documents of theatrical expression. Class lectures and discussions will analyze samples of Native American, Chicano, African American, and Asian American theater, taking into consideration the historical and political context for the creation of these works. Performance exercises will help students identify theatrical forms and techniques used by these theaters, and how these techniques contribute to the overall goals of specific theatrical expressions.

## Required Performances on Campus

#### *subUrbia (21M.873 IAP '08)*

Written by Eric Bogosian directed by David R. Gammons   
presented by MIT Dramashop

The play is set in a fictional suburban town, Burnfield, and is the story of several people trying to figure out their lives, while being visited by their sole successful friend. The story develops throughout the play revealing subtle flaws and noble traits in all of the characters.

#### *Tongue, Smell, Color*

Brenda Dixon Gottschild and Helmut Gottschild

Helmut and Brenda Dixon Gottschild achieve a rare success in "Tongue" - a work that is highly provocative, profoundly personal, and very, very smart. It is an improbable success in that it weaves together dance, music, poetry, readings from academic texts, enactments of searing personal catharsis, and a unique physical vocabulary created by the scholar/artists. That it is a success explodes from the stage in every autobiographical truth the performers utter. Without flinching, they confess the racialized points of attraction and desire which initially divide them, but ultimately bound them together. At times they inflect the autobiographical narrative with fragments of Brenda's groundbreaking scholarship in Africanist performance practice or Helmut's deeply-felt dance. The result is a huge advance in critical scholarship and performance, of vital importance to anyone interested in cultural studies, performance studies, dance, or the nagging persistence of "race" in the way couples view the world.

#### *In the Heart of America*

Written by Naomi Wallace, directed by Michael Ouellette   
presented by MIT Dramashop

Set during the first Gulf War, In The Heart Of America tells the story of a young Arab-American woman, Saboura, on a mission to find out what happened to her army enlisted brother Remzi. Her journey finds her crossing paths with many people who have been deeply affected by the horrors of war, including Remzi's best friend, Private Craver Perry. Although written in 1994, In The Heart Of America resonates with the current situation in Iraq, and the effects of war on family and friends.
